            <h2>Anime Basics: Where to Begin</h2>

            <p>
                The first thing to understand when getting into anime is how genres work within Japanese animation.
                Much like in Western media, anime genres are about marketing and target audiences rather than strict rules.
            </p>

            <p>
                Anime is generally divided into four main demographic categories: <strong>Shōnen</strong>,
                <strong>Shōjo</strong>, <strong>Seinen</strong>, and <strong>Josei</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                These labels don't limit who can enjoy a series—they simply describe who it was originally made for.

            <h2>A Brief History of Anime</h2>
            <p>
                Anime has its roots in early 20th-century Japan, with some of the first animated films 
                appearing in the 1910s like The Dull Sword which is pictured above. Influenced by Western 
                animation, Japanese animators gradually developed a unique visual style and approach to storytelling.
            </p>
            <p>
                After World War II, anime grew alongside television. Osamu Tezuka's <em>Astro Boy</em> 
                (1963) helped define many of anime's visual conventions. By the 1970s and 1980s, anime 
                expanded into new genres and began targeting audiences beyond children.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 1990s and early 2000s, anime reached global audiences through television and home 
                video. Today, anime is a worldwide cultural phenomenon, made widely accessible through
                streaming platforms and enjoyed by people of all ages.
