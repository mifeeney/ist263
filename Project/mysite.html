    <h2>Anime basics: Where to begin</h2>
    <p> The first thing to understand when getting into anime is how genres work within Japanese animation.
        Much like in Western media, genres in anime are largely about marketing and target audiences rather 
        than strict storytelling rules. Anime is generally divided into four main demographic categories. 
        <strong>Shōnen</strong> is aimed at young boys and often features action, adventure, and themes of 
        friendship and growth. <strong>Shōjo</strong> targets young girls and typically focuses on 
        relationships, emotions, and personal development. <strong>Seinen</strong> is created for adult men 
        and tends to explore more complex, mature, or darker themes, while <strong>Josei</strong> is aimed at 
        adult women and often presents realistic portrayals of romance, work, and everyday life.

        Its important to note that these categories dont limit who can enjoy a series—they 
        simply describe who the show was originally made for. Anyone can enjoy anime from any category, and 
        many popular shows blend elements from multiple demographics.</p>
